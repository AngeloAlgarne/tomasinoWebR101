I was a huge K-Pop fan back in Senior High School when I stumbled upon a UST organization’s sudden profile picture change – it was ***TomasinoWeb*** and their TWice rebrand! As a huge Once, I immediately followed the page and was shocked to learn that it was apparently just an April Fool’s movement, but I’ve already scrolled enough and fell in love with what I was seeing. Since then, I swore to join the organization and help create even more fun and quirky content once I pass the arch and become a Thomasian.

Fast forward to today, I’m now leading the organization as its president for the second time, and I’m enjoying every second of it. I find happiness and meaning with what I do, who I do it for, and whom I achieve a lot of things with.

***TomasinoWeb*** is where you are celebrated, is where you uphold press freedom, and where you’re invited to tell the next great story!

    content: `It was the R101 of my third year when I was scrolling for good orgs to join and I saw ***TomasinoWeb***. I said to myself, "Wow this looks like a cool org to join and it looks fun!” At first, I was scared but I still went for it and picked a department that I think I can do well at. Fast forward a few months later, I instantly made a lot of new friends, everyone is very welcoming and super approachable. This is the only organization that I joined that you can truly feel that it's not just work, but also a family. The more I interact with people, the more friends I make. I'm glad I made the decision because every moment I spent in this org was very memorable.`,

During my freshman year, I was not the one who actually discovered ***TomasinoWeb***, but my friend who is also willing to join at least one organization in UST. Kid you not I didn't even expect I would pass and be an HR Staff!

During my sophomore and junior years, these were the days wherein I took time to appreciate what TomWeb is doing for the Thomasian community, because rest assured your contribution is being valued in the organization.
		
Now, in my senior year, and as the new Vice President of Human Resources, I can say that TomWeb would both give you a lot of pressure but at the same time a lot of assurance, it serves as a good training ground for students (at least in my own experience) that whatever your passion is, TW will help you hone that skills and talents of yours.

In my sophomore year, I wanted to join a school organization to meet new people. I came across a recruitment post for ***TomasinoWeb*** on Facebook and decided to apply. Despite doubting my chances, I applied for the Frontend developer position and was very happy to be accepted into the organization. 

Working alongside fellow Thomasians on projects like Draft 143, Lamona, and the organization’s main website not only honed my technical skills, but also developed my people skills. I am very proud of our organization's achievements, especially of the Web Technologies department and I look forward to developing more projects that will benefit our fellow Thomasians in the future.
